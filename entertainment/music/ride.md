"I was in the winter of my life
And the men that I met along the road were my only summer.
At night, I fell asleep with visions of myself
Dancing and laughing and crying with them.

Three years down the line of being on an endless world tour
And my memories of them were the only things that
Substained me and my only real happy times.

I was a singer, not a very popular one,
Who one had dreams of becoming a beautiful poet -
But upon an unfortunate series of events
Saw those dreams dashed
And divided like a millions stars in the night sky
That I wished on over and over again - sparkling and broken.

But I didn't really mind because I knew
That it takes getting everything
You ever wanted and then losing it
To know what true freedom is.

When the people I used to know
Found out what I had been doing
How I had been living - they asked me why.
But there's no use in talking to people who have a home,
They have no idea what it's like to seek safety I
In other people,
For home to be wherever you lie your head.

I was always an unusual girl,
My mother told me I had a chameleon soul.
No morall compass pointing due north, no fixed personality.
Just an inner indecisiveness
That was as wide and as wavering as the ocean.
And if I said that I didn't plan
For it to turn out this was, I'd be lying -
Because I was born to be the other woman.

I belong to no one - who belonged to everyone,
Who had nothing, who wanted everything
With a fire for every experience
And an obsession for freedom
That terrified me to the point I couldn't even talk about -
And pushed me to a nomatic point
Of madness that both dazzled and dizzied me."

I've been out on that open road
You can be my full time, daddy
White and gold
Singing blues has been getting old
You can be my full time, baby
Hot or cold

Don't break me down
I've been traveling too long
I've been trying too hard
With one pretty song

I hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast
I am alone in the night
Been trying hard not to get into trouble, but I
I've got a war in my mind
So, I just ride, I just ride
I just ride, I just ride
Dying young and I'm playing hard
That's the way my father made his life an art
Drink all day and we talk 'til dark
That's the way the road doves do it, ride 'til dark

Don't leave me now
Don't say goodbye
Don't turn around
Leave me high and dry

I hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast
I am alone in the night
Been trying hard not to get into trouble, but I
I've got a war in my mind
I just ride, I just ride
I just ride, I just ride

I'm tired of feeling like I'm `f*cking` crazy
I'm tired of driving 'til I see stars in my eyes
I look up to hear myself saying
"Baby, too much I strive, I just ride"

I hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast
I am alone in the night
Been trying hard not to get into trouble, but I
I've got a war in my mind
I just ride, I just ride
I just ride, I just ride

"Every night I used to pray that I'd find my people -
And finally I did - on the open road.
We had nothing to lose, nothing to gain
Nothing we desired anymore -
Except to make our lives into a work of art.

Live fast. Die young.
Be wild, and have fun
I believe in the country America used to be.
I believe in the person I want to become.
I believe in the freedom of the open road.

And my motto is the same as ever -
I believe in the kindness of strangers.
And when I'm at war with myself - I ride. I just ride.

Who are you?
Are you in touch with all your darkest fantasies?
Have you created a life for yourself where you're free to experience them?
I have! I am fucking crazy, but I am free!"
