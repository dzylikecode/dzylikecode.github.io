# Personality

## Carl Jung

According to Jung, extroverts find meaning outside themselves, in the surrounding world. However, introverts are introspective. They look into themselves and find meaning in themselves.

Extroverts seem to like other people. It is easy for them to form close relationships. They enjoy the excitement of crowds. They tend to be assertive, self-confident, and are often leaders in groups. They are energetic and lead busy lives. In general, they are talkative, adventurous and sociable. Introverts, on the other hand, feel comfortable alone. They avoid large crowds. They are relaxed, thoughtful and reflect before they act. They are often quiet, cautious and have good powers of concentration. They often have creative ideas.

Ring was a huge success because it showed the psychology and personalities of its main characters and it created an atmosphere of tension and anticipation. Asakawa's character transformation is astonishing -- from a curious reporter investigating a story to a human being living in terror as she approaches almost certain death.

## An Indefinable Quality

However, they have other qualities such as sensitivity, self-confidence, `eloquence` and vision.

## Are women better drivers than men

Some people believe that women are better drivers than men. However, others think that women make worse drivers. The idea that women make worse drivers is a stereotype. It comes from a time when women drove less than men, driving was seen as a man's responsibility. There are certainly different views on this controversial question, although there are a number of reasons why a women's personality makes her a more competent driver.

Firstly, women are more patient and polite towards other road users, such as pedestrians and cyclists. In stressful situations, they are more likely to say calm, and less likely to be involved in "road rage" incidents. Secondly, female drivers are more cautious and therefore take fewer risks, for instance when overtaking. Thirdly, they are more responsible so they tend not to drive when tired or after driving alcohol.

On the other hand, many people argue that women cause accidents because they can be indecisive or react slowly because they lack confidence. In addition, they are easily distracted, for example, by children in the car. Research also shows that women find map reading more difficult than men, and can have problems with the difference between left and right. Despite the fact that women have more accidents, insurance is often cheaper for them because the accidents tend to be minor. In particular, women have accidents when parking. This is because women often have poor spatial awareness. In contrast, men tend to have more serious accidents.

To sum up, it can be seen that women make safer drivers than men because of their personalities. This is supported by the fact that women have fewer accidents in general and pay lower insurance premiums than men. On balance, it is clear that women are less competitive and aggressive than men behind the wheel and therefore better drivers.
