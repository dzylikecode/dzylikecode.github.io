## 12 Life on a desert island

Most of us have formed an unrealistic picture of life on a desert island. We sometimes imagine a desert island to be a sort of paradise where the sun always shines. Life there is simple and good. Ripe fruit falls from the trees and you never have to work. The other side of the picture is quite the opposite. Life on a desert island is wretched. You either starve to death or live like Robinson Crusoe, waiting for a boat that never comes. Perhaps there is an element of truth in both of these pictures, but few of us have had the opportunity to find out.

> I also have the same imagination about the desert island and the other thing, so I want to try it by myself.

## 17 The longest suspension bridge in the world

He described it as "a very agreeable situation locate within two small hills in the midst of which flowed a great river".

> I think the sentence is so flexible.

Despite its immensity, it is both simple and elegant, fulfilling its designer's dream to create "an enormous object drawn as faintly as possible".

> I like the opinion.

## 18 Electric current in modern art

Oddly shaped forms that are suspended from the ceiling and move in response to a gust of wind are quite familiar to everybody.

## 23 One man's meat is another man's poison

The sad truth is that most of us have been brought up to eat certain foods and we stick to them all our lives.

> Maybe I can try different food and different books.

## 26 Wanted: a large biscuit in

No one can avoid being influenced by advertisements. Much as we may pride ourselves on our good taste, we are no longer free to choose the thing we want, for advertising exerts a subtle influence on us. In their efforts to persuade us to buy this or that product, advertisers have made a close study of human nature and have classified all our little weaknesses.

## 27 Nothing to sell and nothing to buy

It has been said that everyone lives by selling something. In light of this statement, teachers live by selling knowledge, philosophers by selling wisdom and priests by selling spiritual comfort. Though it may be possible to measure the value of material goods in terms of money, it is extremely difficult to estimate the true value of the services which people perform for us. There are times when we would willing to give everything we possess to save our lives, yet we might grudge paying a surgeon a high fee for offering us precisely this service. The conditions of society are such that skills have to be paid for in the same way that goods are paid for at a shop. Everyone has something to sell.

Beggars almost sell themselves as human beings to arouse the pity of passers-by.

> I think it's good opinion.

His few material possessions make it possible for him to move from place to place with ease.

> Life can be so simple.

We often speak of tramps with contempt and put them in the same class as beggars, but how many of us can honestly say that we have not felt a little envious of their simple way of life and their freedom from care?

## 29 Funny or not?

Whether we find a joke funny or not largely depends on where we have been brought up. The sense of humor is mysteriously bound up with national characteristics.

## 33 A day to remember

We have all experienced days when everything goes wrong. A day may begin well enough, but suddenly everything seems to get out of control. What invariably happens is that a great number of things choose to go wrong at precisely the same moment. It is as if a single unimportant event set up a chain of reactions. Let us suppose that you are preparing a meal and keeping an eye on the baby at the same time. The telephone rings and this marks the prelude to an unforeseen series of catastrophes. While you are on the phone, the baby pulls the tablecloth off the table, smashing half your best crockery and cutting himself in the process. You hang up hurriedly and attend to the baby, crockery, etc. Meanwhile, the meal gets burnt. As if this were not enough to reduce you to tears, your husband arrives, unexpectedly bringing three guests to dinner.

> That's so vivid.

## 35 Justice was done

There are rare instances when justice almost ceases to be an abstract concept. Reward or punishment are meted out entirely independent of human interference. At such times, justice acts like a living force. When we use a phrase like "it serves him right", we are, in part, admitting that a certain set of circumstances has enabled justice to act of its own accord.

## 36 The Westhaven Express

The truth is that when mistakes occur, they are more likely to be ours than theirs.

## 42 Modern cavemen

Cave exploration, or pot-holing, as it has come to be known, is a relatively new sport. Perhaps it is the desire for solitude or the chance of making an unexpected discovery that lures people down to the depths of the earth. It is impossible to give a satisfactory explanation for a pot-holer's motives. For him, caves have the same peculiar fascination that high mountains have for the climber. They arouse instincts that can only be dimly understood.

The cave might never have been discovered had not the entrance been spotted by the distinguished French pot-holer, Berger.

Perhaps it will solve my problem, but I just haven't had time to read it.

## harvest

He will still have intensive practice in four skills, understanding, speaking, listening, and writing, but many of the exercises he will be doing will be less mechanical.

Now it is a curious paradox that formal examination often hinders rather than helps a student to learn a language. however, there should be no need to work at cross-purpose: it is quite possible for the student to go on learning a language and prepare for an examination at the same time. It must be clearly understood that a formal examination with its bias towards the written language will only exert a pernicious influence on language learning when it is regarded as an end in itself.

When the teacher(I think I am my teacher) makes it his aim to get his class through an examination and no more, he will undoubtedly fail to teach the language properly. An examination must always be regarded as something secondary, a by-product that the student will take in his stride. It must never be regarded as an end in itself.

An intermediate course should not only enable a student to go on learning English systematically, but should, incidentally, enable him to pass an examination without special preparation.

1. 不要思考与之无关的东西, 无论它是多么重要. 把注意力放在语句的节奏上, 想想自己会怎么表达英语语句里面的意思, 自己会强调哪部分, 自己怎么组织起整体的意思. 思考语句里面的场景, 把自己带入进去
2. 试图建立场景表达自己的想法, 比如看到"猫有九条命"的实验. I don't like it, because the experiment is a little cruel. But the reason why cats can protect themselves when falling from high buildings is a little fascinating indeed.
3. 自己还是无法控制自己, 会偷懒. 设计这样的目标并不是完全为了目标 "It isn't regarded as an end in itself". 其实, 追求的是每天的状态和"手感".
4. 让文章淌过心灵, 无需带走任何
