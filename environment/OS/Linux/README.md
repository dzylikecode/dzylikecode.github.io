# Linux

> You may want to ask why do you need to memorize all this stuff if you can always look it up. Well, the short answer will be because you can not. What this means is that to look up things efficiently you already need what to look for, and to know what to look for, you need a solid foundation. Once you have this foundation, once you understand what is important and what is not, and how the system is organized, you will be able to efficiently look things up.

## 哲学

- 一切皆是文件
- 只作一件事, 尽力做好
- 通用接口, 协同运作

## go head

- Read one man page per day. Make it a habit. One random man page every day. There are about 6000 man pages on my notebook right now, so it can be done for years.
- Build your own Linux distribution, from scratch: http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/
  You may want to use my Debian appliance for this and other tasks.
- Teach yourself some regular expressions: http://regex.learncodethehardway.org/
- Teach yourself some bash scripting: http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashGuide
- Read books. For example, this one is good: Unix and Linux Administration Handbook. Also read Unix Haters Handbook and write out points from there that you think are still valid. Now realize that all Operating Systems suck, it is just that some suck worse than others.
- Go find a hosting which provides VPS (virtual private severs, or virtual machines) get one. Install something like Apache and your own wiki there. Document your findings online.
- Go to http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/virtuallabs/bb467605.aspx and see what Microsoft technology can do.
- Setup everything from https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Servers on your VPS. Just setup, check if it is working and delete it. Or do not delete. Anyway, it will give you much needed experience with server administration.
